# Predicting Restaurant Success: A Sentiment Analysis and Rating Trend Model

## Overview

This project aims to predict the future success of restaurants by analyzing online reviews and historical rating trends.  The model leverages sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction from review text and incorporates historical rating data to identify patterns and trends indicative of restaurant performance. The analysis provides insights into the key factors driving restaurant success and allows for more accurate forecasting of future performance.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (or specify the specific ML libraries used)
* NLTK (or specify other NLP libraries used)


## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

## Example Output

The script will print key findings of the analysis to the console, including:

* Summary statistics of the sentiment scores and rating trends.
* Key features identified as significant predictors of restaurant success.
* Model evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

Additionally, the project will generate several visualization files (e.g., `sentiment_distribution.png`, `rating_trend.png`) in the `output` directory, illustrating the sentiment analysis results and rating trends over time.  These visualizations provide a visual representation of the data and model findings.

## Data

*(Optional: Add a section describing the data used, its source, and any preprocessing steps.)*  For example:  "The data used in this project consists of restaurant reviews and ratings scraped from [Data Source].  The data was preprocessed to clean and standardize the text data, handle missing values, and prepare it for sentiment analysis and model training."
